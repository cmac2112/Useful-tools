# Useful-tools
A collection of useful tools i have collected and created over time


1. Youtube downloader
     Using pytube i am able to create a good working video downloader instead of relying on some weird website to download the videos i need for my observatory videos i create.
   No more possible virus risk for me :)

   Next step in this project is to get this to a website

# UPDATE 8/9/2025
hasnt worked in a while, archiving as i am no longer in the need to download as many resources for creating observatory videos because well.. im graduated
